=================== Answer =================================================
1. B. All interface methods are implicitly public, so option B is correct and option A is
not. Interface methods may be declared as static or default but are never implicitly
added, so options C and F are incorrect. Option D is incorrect—void is not a modifier;
it is a return type. Option E is a tricky one, because prior to Java 8 all interface methods
would be assumed to be abstract. Since Java 8 now includes default and static
methods and they are never abstract, you cannot assume the abstract modifier will be
implicitly applied to all methods by the compiler.
2. E. The code will not compile because the parent class Mammal doesn’t define a no-argument
constructor, so the first line of a Platypus constructor should be an explicit call
to super(int age). If there was such a call, then the output would be MammalPlatypus,
since the super constructor is executed before the child constructor.
Chapter 5: Class Design 347
3. A, B, D, E. The blank can be filled with any class or interface that is a supertype of
TurtleFrog. Option A is a superclass of TurtleFrog, and option B is the same class,
so both are correct. BrazilianHornedFrog is not a superclass of TurtleFrog, so option
C is incorrect. TurtleFrog inherits the CanHope interface, so option D is correct. All
classes inherit Object, so option E is correct. Finally, Long is an unrelated class that is
not a superclass of TurtleFrog, and is therefore incorrect.
4. C, E. The code doesn’t compile, so option A is incorrect. Option B is also not correct
because the rules for overriding a method allow a subclass to define a method with an
exception that is a subclass of the exception in the parent method. Option C is correct
because the return types are not covariant; in particular, Number is not a subclass
of Integer. Option D is incorrect because the subclass defines a method that is more
accessible than the method in the parent class, which is allowed. Finally, option E is
correct because the method is declared as static in the parent class and not so in the
child class. For nonprivate methods in the parent class, both methods must use static
(hide) or neither should use static (override).

5. A, D, E, F. First off, options B and C are incorrect because protected and public methods
may be overridden, not hidden. Option A is correct because private methods are
always hidden in a subclass. Option D is also correct because static methods cannot
be overridden, only hidden. Options E and F are correct because variables may only be
hidden, regardless of the access modifier.
6. D. The code fails to compile because Beetle, the first concrete subclass, doesn’t implement
getNumberOfSections(), which is inherited as an abstract method; therefore,
option D is correct. Option B is incorrect because there is nothing wrong with this
interface method definition. Option C is incorrect because an abstract class is not
required to implement any abstract methods, including those inherited from an interface.
Option E is incorrect because the code fails at compilation-time.
7. B, C. A reference to an object requires an explicit cast if referenced with a subclass,
so option A is incorrect. If the cast is to a superclass reference, then an explicit cast is
not required. Because of polymorphic parameters, if a method takes the superclass of
an object as a parameter, then any subclass references may be used without a cast, so
option B is correct. All objects extend java.lang.Object, so if a method takes that
type, any valid object, including null, may be passed; therefore, option C is correct.
Some cast exceptions can be detected as errors at compile-time, but others can only be
detected at runtime, so D is incorrect. Due to the nature of polymorphism, a public
instance method can be overridden in a subclass and calls to it will be replaced even in
the superclass it was defined, so E is incorrect.
8. F. The interface variable amount is correctly declared, with public and static being
assumed and automatically inserted by the compiler, so option B is incorrect. The
method declaration for eatGrass() on line 3 is incorrect because the method has been
marked as static but no method body has been provided. The method declaration for
chew() on line 4 is also incorrect, since an interface method that provides a body must
be marked as default or static explicitly. Therefore, option F is the correct answer
since this code contains two compile-time errors.
9. A. Although the definition of methods on lines 2 and 5 vary, both will be converted to
public abstract by the compiler. Line 4 is fine, because an interface can have public
or default access. Finally, the class Falcon doesn’t need to implement the interface
methods because it is marked as abstract. Therefore, the code will compile without
issue.

10. B, C, E, F. Option A is wrong, because an abstract class may contain concrete methods.
Since Java 8, interfaces may also contain concrete methods in form of static or
default methods. Although all variables in interfaces are assumed to be public static
final, abstract classes may contain them as well, so option B is correct. Both abstract
classes and interfaces can be extended with the extends keyword, so option C is correct.
Only interfaces can contain default methods, so option D is incorrect. Both
abstract classes and interfaces can contain static methods, so option E is correct. Both
structures require a concrete subclass to be instantiated, so option F is correct. Finally,
though an instance of an object that implements an interface inherits java.lang.
Object, the interface itself doesn’t; otherwise, Java would support multiple inheritance
for objects, which it doesn’t. Therefore, option G is incorrect.
11. A, D, E. Interface variables are assumed to be public static final; therefore, options
A, D, and E are correct. Options B and C are incorrect because interface variables must
be public—interfaces are implemented by classes, not inherited by interfaces. Option F
is incorrect because variables can never be abstract.
12. B. This code compiles and runs without issue, outputting false, so option B is the
correct answer. The first declaration of isBlind() is as a default interface method,
assumed public. The second declaration of isBlind() correctly overrides the default
interface method. Finally, the newly created Owl instance may be automatically cast to
a Nocturnal reference without an explicit cast, although adding it doesn’t break the
code.
13. A. The code compiles and runs without issue, so options E and F are incorrect. The
printName() method is an overload in Spider, not an override, so both methods may
be called. The call on line 8 references the version that takes an int as input defined
in the Spider class, and the call on line 9 references the version in the Arthropod class
that takes a double. Therefore, SpiderArthropod is output and option A is the correct
answer.
14. C. The code compiles without issue, so option A is wrong. Option B is incorrect, since
an abstract class could implement HasVocalCords without the need to override the
makeSound() method. Option C is correct; any class that implements CanBark automatically
inherits its methods, as well as any inherited methods defined in the parent
interface. Because option C is correct, it follows that option D is incorrect. Finally, an
interface can extend multiple interfaces, so option E is incorrect.

15. B. Concrete classes are, by definition, not abstract, so option A is incorrect. A concrete
class must implement all inherited abstract methods, so option B is correct. Option C
is incorrect; a superclass may have already implemented an inherited interface, so the
concrete subclass would not need to implement the method. Concrete classes can be
both final and not final, so option D is incorrect. Finally, abstract methods must be
overridden by a concrete subclass, so option E is incorrect.
16. E. The code doesn’t compile, so options A and B are incorrect. The issue with line 9 is
that layEggs() is marked as final in the superclass Reptile, which means it cannot be
overridden. There are no errors on any other lines, so options C and D are incorrect.
17. B. This may look like a complex question, but it is actually quite easy. Line 2 contains
an invalid definition of an abstract method. Abstract methods cannot contain a body,
so the code will not compile and option B is the correct answer. If the body {} was
removed from line 2, the code would still not compile, although it would be line 8 that
would throw the compilation error. Since dive() in Whale is abstract and Orca extends
Whale, then it must implement an overridden version of dive(). The method on line
9 is an overloaded version of dive(), not an overridden version, so Orca is an invalid
subclass and will not compile.
18. E. The code doesn’t compile because line 6 contains an incompatible override of the
getNumberOfGills(int input) method defined in the Aquatic interface. In particular,
int and String are not covariant returns types, since int is not a subclass of String.
Note that line 5 compiles without issue; getNumberOfGills() is an overloaded method
that is not related to the parent interface method that takes an int value.
19. A, C, F. First off, Cobra is a subclass of Snake, so option A can be used. GardenSnake is
not defined as a subclass of Snake, so it cannot be used and option B is incorrect. The
class Snake is not marked as abstract, so it can be instantiated and passed, so option
C is correct. Next, Object is a superclass of Snake, not a subclass, so it also cannot be
used and option D is incorrect. The class String is unrelated in this example, so option
E is incorrect. Finally, a null value can always be passed as an object value, regardless
of type, so option F is correct.
20. A. The code compiles and runs without issue, so options C, D, and E are incorrect.
The trick here is that the method fly() is marked as private in the parent class Bird,
which means it may only be hidden, not overridden. With hidden methods, the specific
method used depends on where it is referenced. Since it is referenced within the Bird
class, the method declared on line 2 was used, and option A is correct. Alternatively,
if the method was referenced within the Pelican class, or if the method in the parent
class was marked as protected and overridden in the subclass, then the method on line
9 would have been used.
