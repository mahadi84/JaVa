==============================================================

--------------------01. Define the scope of variables----------------------------------
Question: What is the difference between instance variables and local variables in Java?

Answer: Instance variables are declared in a class but outside any method, constructor, or block. They are created when an object of the class is created and destroyed when the object is destroyed. Local variables are declared inside a method, constructor, or block and are only accessible within that method, constructor, or block. They are created when the method, constructor, or block is entered and destroyed when it is exited.
Question: How does the scope of a static variable differ from an instance variable in Java?

Answer: Static variables are declared with the static keyword and belong to the class rather than any instance. They are created when the class is loaded into memory and destroyed when the class is unloaded. Instance variables, on the other hand, are tied to specific instances of a class and each instance has its own copy of the instance variable.
Question: Can you declare a local variable with the same name as an instance variable in Java? What is the behavior?

Answer: Yes, you can declare a local variable with the same name as an instance variable. This is known as variable shadowing. Within the scope of the local variable, the local variable will hide the instance variable. You can still access the instance variable using the this keyword (e.g., this.variableName).
Question: What is the scope of a method parameter in Java?

Answer: The scope of a method parameter is limited to the method in which it is declared. It is created when the method is called and destroyed when the method exits. Method parameters cannot be accessed outside of the method.
Question: Explain the scope of a variable declared inside a for loop in Java.

Answer: A variable declared inside a for loop has its scope limited to the body of the loop. It is created when the loop is entered and destroyed when the loop exits. It cannot be accessed outside the loop.
Question: How does the final keyword affect the scope of a local variable in Java?

Answer: The final keyword does not affect the scope of a local variable; it only prevents the variable from being reassigned once it has been initialized. The scope of a final local variable is the same as any other local variable, limited to the method, constructor, or block in which it is declared.
Question: Can you declare a variable with the same name in an inner class as in the outer class? How would you access both?

Answer: Yes, you can declare a variable with the same name in an inner class as in the outer class. This creates two separate variables with the same name. To access the outer class variable from the inner class, you can use OuterClassName.this.variableName. To access the inner class variable, you can simply use variableName.

        list.forEach(item -> System.out.println(item));
    }
}
```

--------------------04. Run a Java program from the command line;  ---------------------------

Running a Java program from the command line involves a few steps, including writing the Java code, compiling it with the Java compiler, and then executing the compiled bytecode with the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Here's a step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Write Your Java Code

Create a Java file with your code. For example, let's write a simple "Hello, World!" program.

1. Open a text editor and write the following code:
    ```java
    public class HelloWorld {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Hello, World!");
        }
    }
    ```

2. Save the file as `HelloWorld.java`.

### Step 2: Open the Command Line

Open the command line (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS or Linux).

### Step 3: Navigate to the Directory

Navigate to the directory where you saved the `HelloWorld.java` file. You can use the `cd` command to change directories. For example:
```sh
cd path/to/your/java/file
```

### Step 4: Compile the Java Code

Use the `javac` command to compile your Java file. This command will generate a `HelloWorld.class` file containing the bytecode.
```sh
javac HelloWorld.java
```

If there are no errors, the `HelloWorld.class` file will be created in the same directory.

### Step 5: Run the Compiled Java Program

Use the `java` command to run the compiled Java program. You should specify the class name without the `.class` extension.
```sh
java HelloWorld
```

You should see the output:
```sh
Hello, World!
```

### Full Example

Here is a complete example showing all the commands:

1. Create a file named `HelloWorld.java` with the following content:
    ```java
    public class HelloWorld {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Hello, World!");
        }
    }
    ```

2. Open the command line and navigate to the directory containing `HelloWorld.java`:
    ```sh
    cd path/to/your/java/file
    ```

3. Compile the Java file:
    ```sh
    javac HelloWorld.java
    ```

4. Run the compiled Java program:
    ```sh
    java HelloWorld
    ```

### Additional Tips

- **Setting Up the Environment**: Ensure that the `javac` and `java` commands are available in your PATH. You can check this by running `javac -version` and `java -version`. If not, you may need to add the JDK bin directory to your system's PATH.
- **Handling Packages**: If your Java file includes a package declaration, you need to navigate to the root directory of your package structure and use the fully qualified class name to compile and run the program.

### Example with Package

1. Create a file named `com/example/HelloWorld.java` with the following content:
    ```java
    package com.example;

    public class HelloWorld {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Hello, World!");
        }
    }
    ```

2. Open the command line and navigate to the directory containing the `com` directory:
    ```sh
    cd path/to/your/java/file
    ```

3. Compile the Java file:
    ```sh
    javac com/example/HelloWorld.java
    ```

4. Run the compiled Java program using the fully qualified class name:
    ```sh
    java com.example.HelloWorld
    ```



--------------------05. Produce console output  ----------------------------------------------
Producing console output in Java is typically done using the `System.out.println()`, `System.out.print()`, or `System.out.printf()` methods. Here is a brief overview of each method and how to use them:

### 1. `System.out.println()`

The `System.out.println()` method prints a message to the console and then moves the cursor to a new line. It is the most commonly used method for producing console output.

**Example:**

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
        System.out.println("This is a new line.");
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
Hello, World!
This is a new line.
```

### 2. `System.out.print()`

The `System.out.print()` method prints a message to the console but does not move the cursor to a new line. This allows you to continue printing on the same line.

**Example:**

```java
public class PrintExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.print("Hello, ");
        System.out.print("World!");
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
Hello, World!
```

### 3. `System.out.printf()`

The `System.out.printf()` method provides formatted output. It allows you to format strings using format specifiers, similar to the `printf` function in C.

**Example:**

```java
public class PrintfExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int age = 30;
        String name = "Alice";
        double score = 95.5;

        System.out.printf("Name: %s, Age: %d, Score: %.2f%n", name, age, score);
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
Name: Alice, Age: 30, Score: 95.50
```

### Example Program Using All Methods

Here is a full example demonstrating all three methods:

```java
public class ConsoleOutputExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Using System.out.println()
        System.out.println("This is an example of println.");
        System.out.println("It moves to a new line after printing.");

        // Using System.out.print()
        System.out.print("This is an example of print.");
        System.out.print(" It continues on the same line.");

        // Using System.out.printf()
        System.out.printf("%nThis is an example of printf. Name: %s, Age: %d, Score: %.2f%n", "Bob", 25, 88.75);
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
This is an example of println.
It moves to a new line after printing.
This is an example of print. It continues on the same line.
This is an example of printf. Name: Bob, Age: 25, Score: 88.75
```

### Explanation

- `System.out.println("...")`: Prints the string and moves to a new line.
- `System.out.print("...")`: Prints the string without moving to a new line.
- `System.out.printf("format string", args)`: Prints a formatted string. The `%n` format specifier in `printf` is used to insert a newline.


--------------------06. Import other Java packages to make them accessible in your code  ---------------------------

In Java, importing packages allows you to use classes and interfaces that are defined in other packages. This helps you organize and reuse code more efficiently. There are several ways to import packages in Java:

### 1. Importing a Single Class

To import a specific class from a package, you use the `import` statement followed by the fully qualified class name.

**Syntax:**

```java
import packageName.ClassName;
```

**Example:**

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class ImportExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");
        list.add("World");
        System.out.println(list);
    }
}
```

### 2. Importing All Classes from a Package

To import all classes and interfaces from a package, you use the `import` statement followed by the package name and a `.*`.

**Syntax:**

```java
import packageName.*;
```

**Example:**

```java
import java.util.*;

public class ImportExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");
        list.add("World");
        System.out.println(list);

        HashMap<String, String> map = new HashMap<>();
        map.put("Key1", "Value1");
        map.put("Key2", "Value2");
        System.out.println(map);
    }
}
```

### 3. Importing Static Members

If you want to import static members (fields and methods) of a class, you use the `import static` statement.

**Syntax:**

```java
import static packageName.ClassName.staticMemberName;
```

or to import all static members:

```java
import static packageName.ClassName.*;
```

**Example:**

```java
import static java.lang.Math.*;

public class StaticImportExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double result = sqrt(25);  // No need to write Math.sqrt()
        System.out.println("Square root of 25 is: " + result);

        double piValue = PI;  // No need to write Math.PI
        System.out.println("Value of PI is: " + piValue);
    }
}
```

### Practical Example

Here is a practical example that combines various types of imports:

1. Create a package named `com.example.utils` and a class `StringUtils` inside it:

    ```java
    // File: com/example/utils/StringUtils.java
    package com.example.utils;

    public class StringUtils {
        public static String reverse(String str) {
            return new StringBuilder(str).reverse().toString();
        }
    }
    ```

2. Create a main class that uses `StringUtils` from the `com.example.utils` package:

    ```java
    // File: Main.java
    import com.example.utils.StringUtils;
    import java.util.*;

    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            String original = "Hello World";
            String reversed = StringUtils.reverse(original);

            System.out.println("Original: " + original);
            System.out.println("Reversed: " + reversed);

            ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
            list.add("One");
            list.add("Two");
            System.out.println(list);
        }
    }
    ```

### Compiling and Running the Code

1. Save the `StringUtils` class in the directory `com/example/utils/`.

2. Save the `Main` class in the root directory where the `com` directory is located.

3. Open the command line and navigate to the root directory.

4. Compile the `StringUtils` class:

    ```sh
    javac com/example/utils/StringUtils.java
    ```

5. Compile the `Main` class:

    ```sh
    javac Main.java
    ```

6. Run the `Main` class:

    ```sh
    java Main
    ```

**Output:**

```
Original: Hello World
Reversed: dlroW olleH

--------------------07. Compare and contrast the features and components of Java such as: platform independence, object orientation, encapsulation, etc.  ---------------------------
Java is a widely-used programming language known for its powerful features and capabilities. 
Here are comparisons and contrasts of some key features and components of Java: platform independence, object orientation, and encapsulation.

### Platform Independence

**Definition:**
- **Platform Independence** means that a program written in Java can run on any device that has the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed, regardless of the underlying hardware and operating system.

**Features:**
- **Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA):** Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which can be executed on any JVM. This allows the same Java program to run on different platforms without modification.
- **Java Virtual Machine (JVM):** The JVM is the key to Java's platform independence. It abstracts the underlying hardware and operating system, allowing Java bytecode to run on any device with a compatible JVM.

**Benefits:**
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Developers can write a single version of their application and deploy it across multiple platforms, reducing development and maintenance costs.
- **Portability:** Java programs can easily be moved from one platform to another without needing recompilation.

**Examples:**
- A Java program developed on Windows can run on Linux or macOS without any changes to the code.

### Object Orientation

**Definition:**
- **Object Orientation** is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data (fields) and code (methods). Java is inherently an object-oriented language.

**Features:**
- **Classes and Objects:** Java uses classes to define blueprints for objects. An object is an instance of a class.
- **Inheritance:** Java allows classes to inherit properties and methods from other classes, promoting code reuse and hierarchical classification.
- **Polymorphism:** Java supports polymorphism, allowing objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, enabling flexible and reusable code.
- **Abstraction:** Java allows the creation of abstract classes and interfaces to define abstract data types, which can be implemented by concrete classes.

**Benefits:**
- **Modularity:** Object-oriented design encourages modularity, making code easier to understand, maintain, and debug.
- **Reusability:** Code can be reused through inheritance and composition, reducing redundancy and improving efficiency.
- **Flexibility and Scalability:** Object-oriented design makes it easier to scale and extend applications by adding new classes and objects.

**Examples:**
- Creating a `Vehicle` class and then extending it with `Car` and `Bike` subclasses, each having specific implementations of methods defined in `Vehicle`.

### Encapsulation

**Definition:**
- **Encapsulation** is the practice of bundling data (fields) and methods that operate on that data into a single unit or class, and restricting access to some of the object's components.

**Features:**
- **Access Modifiers:** Java uses access modifiers (private, protected, public, and default) to control the visibility and accessibility of classes, methods, and fields.
- **Getters and Setters:** Java encourages the use of getter and setter methods to access and modify private fields, ensuring data integrity and encapsulation.
- **Data Hiding:** Encapsulation hides the internal state of an object from the outside world and only exposes a controlled interface.

**Benefits:**
- **Data Protection:** By restricting direct access to an object's fields, encapsulation protects the data from unintended or harmful modifications.
- **Maintainability:** Encapsulation makes it easier to change the internal implementation of a class without affecting other parts of the program.
- **Improved Modularity:** Encapsulation helps in organizing code into distinct sections with well-defined interfaces, enhancing modularity and readability.

**Examples:**
- Defining private fields in a class and providing public getter and setter methods to access and modify those fields.

### Comparison and Contrast

1. **Platform Independence vs. Object Orientation:**
   - **Platform Independence** focuses on the ability of Java programs to run on any platform with a JVM, while **Object Orientation** is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects and classes.
   - Platform independence is achieved through the JVM and bytecode, whereas object orientation is achieved through language features like classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.

2. **Object Orientation vs. Encapsulation:**
   - **Object Orientation** encompasses broader principles, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. **Encapsulation** is specifically about bundling data and methods and restricting access to the inner workings of objects.
   - While encapsulation is a fundamental aspect of object-oriented programming, object orientation also includes other concepts like inheritance and polymorphism to promote code reuse and flexibility.

3. **Platform Independence vs. Encapsulation:**
   - **Platform Independence** is a feature that ensures Java programs can run on any platform, while **Encapsulation** is a programming principle that ensures internal data protection and controlled access.
   - Platform independence relates to the deployment and execution environment of Java applications, whereas encapsulation is about the design and organization of code within those applications.
