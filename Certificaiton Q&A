#################### Section 1: Java Basics #################
1. **Q:** What is the purpose of the `main` method in Java?
   - **A:** The `main` method serves as the entry point for Java applications. Its signature is `public static void main(String[] args)`.

2. **Q:** What is a constructor in Java?
   - **A:** A constructor is a special method used to initialize objects. It has the same name as the class and does not have a return type.

3. **Q:** What is the default value of an instance variable in Java?
   - **A:** The default values are `0` for numeric types, `false` for boolean, and `null` for object references.

4. **Q:** Can a constructor be private in Java?
   - **A:** Yes, a constructor can be private, typically used in singleton pattern to restrict instantiation.

5. **Q:** What is the use of the `this` keyword in Java?
   - **A:** `this` refers to the current instance of the class.


#################### Section 2: Working with Java Data Types #################
6. **Q:** What are primitive data types in Java?

    - **A:** The access modifiers are `private`, `default`, `protected`, and `public`.

29. **Q:** What is encapsulation in Java?
    - **A:** Encapsulation is the bundling of data with methods that operate on that data, restricting direct access to some of the object's components.

30. **Q:** How do you achieve encapsulation in Java?
    - **A:** By using private fields and providing public getter and setter methods.


#################### Section 7: Working with Inheritance #################

    - **A:** A finally block contains code that is always executed, regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not.

40. **Q:** What is the difference between `throw` and `throws`?
    - **A:** `throw` is used to explicitly throw an exception, while `throws` is used in a method signature to declare that the method may throw exceptions.


#################### Section 9: Working with Classes and Interfaces #################
41. **Q:** What is an abstract class in Java?
    - **A:** An abstract class cannot be instantiated and can have abstract methods (methods without a body).

####################  Section 17: Java Best Practices and Design Patterns #################
81. **Q:** What is the Singleton pattern?
    - **A:** It ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

82. **Q:** How do you implement the Singleton pattern in Java?
    - **A:** By making the constructor private and providing a static method that returns the instance.

83. **Q:** What is the Factory pattern?

### Section 18: Working with Annotations
86. **Q:** What is an annotation in Java?
    - **A:** An annotation is a form of metadata that provides data about a program but is not part of the program itself.

87. **Q:** What is the `@Override` annotation used for?
    - **A:** It indicates that a method is intended to override a method in a superclass.

88. **Q:** What does the `@Deprecated` annotation signify?
    - **A:** It indicates that a method or class is obsolete and should not be used.

    - **A:** It is the process of reclaiming memory by deleting objects that are no longer reachable in the program.

92. **Q:** What is the purpose of the `finalize` method?
    - **A:** It is called by the garbage collector on an object when garbage collection determines that there are no more references to the object.

93. **Q:** How do you request garbage collection in Java?
    - **A:** By calling `System.gc()`, though it's only a request.

94. **Q:** What is a memory leak in Java?
    - **A:** It occurs when objects are no longer used but are still referenced, preventing the garbage collector from reclaiming their memory.

95. **Q:** What are strong, weak, soft, and phantom references?
    - **A:** They are different levels of references that determine the garbage collection behavior for the referenced objects.


################# Section 20: Miscellaneous #################
