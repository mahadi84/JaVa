-----------01. Declare and initialize variables (including casting of primitive data types)---------------------

* What is a variable?
* What are the different data types in Java?
* What is the difference between implicit and explicit casting?
* How do you declare and initialize a variable?
* What are the rules for naming variables?


######## Understanding Variables ################
    * A variable is a named storage location that holds a value.
    * In Java, variables must be declared before use.
    * The data type of a variable determines the type of data it can hold.

######## Primitive Data Types ################
Java has eight primitive data types:
    > byte: 8-bit signed integer (-128 to 127)
    > short: 16-bit signed integer (-32768 to 32767)
    > int: 32-bit signed integer (-2147483648 to 2147483647)
    > long: 64-bit signed integer (-9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807)
    > float: 32-bit single-precision floating-point number
    > double: 64-bit double-precision floating-point number
    > char: 16-bit Unicode character
    > boolean: true or false

######## Declaration and Initialization 
**Declaration:** Specifies the data type and name of the variable.
    int age;
    double salary;
    char initial;
    boolean isStudent;

**Initialization:** Assigns a value to the variable.
    int age = 25;
    double salary = 45000.50;
    char initial = 'A';
    boolean isStudent = true;

######## Casting Primitive Data Types ################
    * Casting is converting a value from one data type to another.
    * Implicit casting (widening) happens automatically for compatible types (e.g., int to double).
    * Explicit casting (narrowing) requires a cast operator to prevent data loss.

        int num = 10;
        double d = num; // Implicit casting (int to double)

        double pi = 3.14159;
        int i = (int) pi; // Explicit casting (double to int, potential data loss)

######## Important Considerations ################
    * Variable names must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($).
    * Variable names are case-sensitive.
    * Keywords cannot be used as variable names.
    * Use meaningful variable names to improve code readability.
    * Initialize variables before using them to avoid errors.

######## Example 
    public class VariableExample {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            byte age = 25;
            short population = 32767;
            int salary = 50000;
            long worldPopulation = 7000000000L; // L suffix for long
            float pi = 3.14159f; // f suffix for float
            double gravity = 9.8;
            char initial = 'J';
            boolean isEmployed = true;

            // Casting example
            int x = (int) 3.14; // x will be 3
        }
    }
