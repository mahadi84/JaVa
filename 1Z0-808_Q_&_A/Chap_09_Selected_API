================================ Answers =============================

1. C. Option A is incorrect because StringBuilder does not support multiple threads. In fact, threads aren’t even covered on the OCA, which should be your clue that this answer
is wrong! You don’t need to know this for the exam, but StringBuffer supports multiple threads. Option B is incorrect because == compares references, not values. Option D is
incorrect because both String and StringBuilder support languages and encodings. Option C is correct and the primary reason to use StringBuilder. String often creates a
new object each time you call certain methods on the object like concat(). StringBuilder optimizes operations like append() because it is mutable.
2. D. A String can be created using a literal rather than calling a constructor directly, making Option A incorrect. A string pool exists for String reuse, making Option B incorrect.
A String is final and immutable, making Option C incorrect and Option D correct.
3. D. This question is testing whether you understand how method chaining works. Option A creates an empty StringBuilder and then adds the five characters in clown to it. Option B
simply creates the clown when calling the constructor. Finally, Option C creates the same value, just in two parts. Therefore, Option D is correct.
4. B. Since StringBuilder is mutable, each call to append adds to the value. When calling print, toString() is automatically called and 333 806 1601 is output. 
Therefore, Option B is correct.

5. B. List is an interface and not a class. It cannot be instantiated. While Object is a concrete class, it does not implement the List interface so it cannot be assigned to frisbees.
Note that if you were to add an explicit cast, it would compile and throw an exception at runtime. Of the three options, only ArrayList can fill in the blank, so Option B is correct.
6. C. An ArrayList does not automatically sort the elements. It simply remembers them in order. Since Java uses zero-based indexes, Option C is correct.
7. C. Calling the constructor and then insert() is an example of method chaining. However, the sb.length() call is a problem. The sb reference doesn’t exist until after the chained
calls complete. Just because it happens to be on a separate line doesn’t change when the reference is created. Since the code does not compile, Option C is correct.
8. A. While the ArrayList is declared with an initial capacity of one element, it is free to expand as more elements are added. Each of the three calls to the add() method adds an
element to the end of the ArrayList. The remove() method call deletes the element at index 2, which is Art. Therefore, Option A is correct.
9. C. On line 12, the value of the StringBuilder is 12. On line 13, it becomes 123. Since StringBuilder is mutable, storing the result in the same reference is redundant. Then on
line 14, the value is reversed, giving us 321 and making Option C correct.
10. D. Option A is incorrect as it describes autoboxing. Options B and C are not possible in Java. Option D is correct as it describes lambdas. Lambdas use deferred execution and can
be run elsewhere in the codebase.

11. D. A StringBuilder is mutable, so the length is two after line 6 completes. The StringBuilder methods return a reference to the same object so you can chain method
calls. Therefore, line and anotherLine refer to the same object. This means that line
7 prints true. Then on line 9, both references point to the same object of length 2, and Option D is correct.
12. D. The add() and get() methods are available on ArrayList. However, ArrayList uses size rather than length to get the number of elements. Therefore, Option D is
correct. If length was changed to size, Option B would compile if put in the blank. Option A still wouldn’t compile in the blank because a cast would be needed to store the value in str.
13. D. Option A is tricky, but incorrect. While a lambda can have zero parameters, a Predicate cannot. A Predicate is defined as a type mapping to a boolean. Option B is
clearly incorrect as -> separates the parts of a lambda. Options C and D are similar. Option C is incorrect because return is only allowed when the brackets are present. Option D is
correct.
14. A. Lines 20–22 create an ArrayList with two elements. Line 23 replaces the second one with a new value. Now chars is [a, c]. Then line 24 removes the first element, making it
just [c]. Option A is correct because there is only one element, but it is not the value b.

15. D. Trick question. There is no reverse method on the String class. There is one on the StringBuilder class. Therefore, the code does not compile, and Option D is correct.
16. A. When creating a lambda with only one parameter, there are a few variants. The pred1
approach shows the shortest way, where the type is omitted and the parentheses are omitted. The pred2 approach is similar except it includes the parentheses. Both are legal. The
pred4 approach is the long way with both the parentheses and type specified. The only one that doesn’t compile is pred3. The parentheses are required if including the type.
17. A. This is a correct example of code that uses a lambda. The interface has a single abstract method. The lambda correctly takes one double parameter and returns a boolean. This
matches the interface. The lambda syntax is correct. Since 45 is greater than 5, Option A is correct.
18. A. Since String is immutable, each call to concat() returns a new object with the new value. However, that return value is ignored and the teams variable never changes in value.
Therefore it stays as 694, and Option A is correct.
19. A. The ArrayList class is in the java.util package, making I correct. The LocalDate class is in the java.time package, making II incorrect. The String class is in the
java.lang package, which means you can use it without typing an import, making III incorrect. Therefore, Option A is correct.
20. C. Option A is straightforward and outputs radical robots. Option B does the same in a convoluted manner. First Option B removes all the characters after the first one. It
doesn’t matter that there aren’t actually 100 characters to delete. Then it appends obots to the end, making the builder contain robots. Finally, it inserts the remainder of the
string immediately after the first index. Try drawing the flow if this is hard to envision. Option D also creates the same value by inserting robots immediately after the end of
the StringBuilder. Option C is close, but it has an off-by-one error. It inserts robots after the letter l rather than after the space. This results in the value radicalrobots
followed by a space. Option C is different than the others and the correct answer.

21. A. Since we are creating the list from an array, it is a fixed size. We are allowed to change elements. At the end of this code, museums is [Art, Science]. Therefore, it contains Art,
and Option A is correct.
22. D. Options A and B are not true if the String is "deabc". Option C is not true if the String is "abcde". Option D is true in all cases.
23. D. Line 25 does not compile. On an ArrayList, the method to get the number of elements is size. The length() method is used for a String or StringBuilder.
24. B. The toString() method call doesn’t help in narrowing things down as all Java objects have that method available. The other two methods are more helpful. String is the only
type of these three to have a startsWith() method, making Option B correct. String also has the replace() method declared here. If you memorized the whole API, you might
know that StringBuilder also has a replace() method, but it requires three parameters instead of two. Please don’t memorize the API in that level of detail. We included what you
need to know in our study guide. If you do have this outside knowledge, be careful not to read into the questions!
25. B. The <> is known as the diamond operator. Here, it works as a shortcut to avoid repeating the generic type twice for the same declaration. On the right side of the expression, this
is a handy shortcut. Java still needs the type on the left side so there is something to infer. In the figure, position P is the left side and position Q is the right side. 
Therefore, Option B is correct.

26. D. The type in the lambda must match the generic declared on the Predicate. In this case, that is String. Therefore, Options A and B are incorrect. While Option C is of the correct
type, it uses the variable s, which is already in use from the main() method parameter. Therefore, none of these are correct, and Option D is the answer.
27. A. A String is immutable so a different object is returned on line 6. The object anotherLine points to is of length 2 after line 6 completes. However, the original line
reference still points to an object of length 1. Therefore, Option A is correct.
28. C. While it is common for a Predicate to have a generic type, it is not required. However, it is treated like a Predicate of type Object if the generic type is missing. Since
startsWith() does not exist on Object, the first line does not compile, and Option C is correct.
29. B. LocalDate only includes the date portion and not the time portion. There is no class named LocalTimeStamp. The other two, LocalDateTime and LocalTime, both include the
time elements, making Option B correct.
30. D. Line 4 creates a String of length 5. Since String is immutable, line 5 creates a new String with the value 1 and assigns it to builder. Remember that indexes in Java begin
with 0, so the substring() method is taking the values from the fifth element through the end. Since the first element is the last element, there’s only one character in there. Then line
6 tries to retrieve the second indexed element. Since there is only one element, this gives a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException, and Option D is correct.

31. D. When you’re using brackets, both the return keyword and semicolon are needed for the lambda to compile, making Option D correct.
32. B. Java 8 date and time classes are immutable. The plusDays method returns a LocalDate object presenting Christmas Eve (December 24th). However, this return value is ignored.
The xmas variable still represents the original value, so Option B is correct.
33. A. Line 3 creates an empty StringBuilder. Line 4 adds three characters to it. Line 5 removes the first character, resulting in ed. Line 6 deletes the characters starting at position
1 and ending right before position 2, which removes the character at index 1, which is d. The only character left is e, so Option A is correct.
34. B. While it is common for a Predicate to have a generic type, it is not required. When the generic is omitted, it is treated like a Predicate of type Object. Since the equals()
method exists on Object, this is fine. Option B is correct because the Predicate tests as false.

35. C. In Java, most things use zero-based indexes, including arrays and a String. Months are an exception to this convention starting Java 8. This makes the answer either Option C or
D. However, LocalTime does not contain date fields, so it has to be Option C.
36. C. Predicate is an interface with one method. The method signature is boolean test(T t). Option C is the answer because the method accepts one parameter rather than two.
37. B. Be careful here. The Period class uses a static helper method to return the period. It does not chain method calls, so period1 only represents three days. Since three days is less
than 10 days, period2 is larger, and Option B is correct.
38. B. The code starts by correctly creating a date representing January 1, 2017, and a period representing one day. It then explicitly defines the format as month followed by day
followed by year. Finally, the code subtracts a day, giving us the formatted version of December 31, 2016.
39. C. The trim() method returns a String with all leading and trailing white space removed. In this question, that’s the seven-character String: ":) - (:". Options A and B are
incorrect because they do not remove the first blank space in happy. Option D is incorrect because it does not remove the last character in happy. Therefore, Option C is correct.
40. C. The Period class creates immutable objects and is usually used to add/subtract from a LocalDate or LocalDateTime object. It allows creating date, week, month, or year periods.
Since it cannot be used for time, Option C is the answer.

41. D. Line 4 creates a StringBuilder of length 5. Pay attention to the substring() method StringBuilder. It returns a String with the value 321. It does not change the
StringBuilder itself. Then line 6 is retrieving the second indexed element from that unchanged value, which is 4. Therefore, Option D is correct.
42. B. This one is tricky. There are two remove() methods available on ArrayList. One removes an element by index and takes an int parameter. The other removes an element
by value. Due to the generics, it takes an Integer parameter in this example. Since the int primitive is a better match, the element with index 2 is removed, which is the value of 1.
Therefore, Option B is correct.
43. C. ArrayList has a size() method rather than a length() method, making Option A incorrect. The charAt() and length() methods are declared on both String and
StringBuilder. However, the insert() method is only declared on a StringBuilder and not a String. Therefore, Option C is correct.
44. C. The minusNanos and plusNanos are the smallest units available, making Option C correct. Option D is incorrect because LocalTime is not that granular. Note that while you can
add milliseconds by adding many nanoseconds, there isn’t a method for it. A millisecond is also larger than a nanosecond. Finally, don’t be tricked by the fact that LocalTime is immutable.
You can still add time; it just gets returned as a different object.

45. D. When creating a formatter object, remember that MM represents month while mm represents minute. Since there are not minutes defined on a LocalDate object, the code throws
an UnsupportedTemporalTypeException. You don’t need to know the name of the exception, but you do need to know that an exception is thrown.
46. D. There are two signatures for the replace() method. One takes two char parameters. The other signature takes a CharSequence. Both String and StringBuilder implement
this interface. This makes all three alternatives correct, and Option D is correct.
47. C. Pay attention to the data types. The print() method is looping through a list of String objects. However, the Predicate expects an Integer. Since these don’t match, the if
statement does not compile.
48. D. Line 12 creates an empty ArrayList. While it isn’t recommended to use generics on only the left side of the assignment operator, this is allowed. It just gives a warning. Lines
13 and 14 add two elements. Line 15 resets to an empty ArrayList. Line 16 adds an element, so now we have an ArrayList of size 1. Line 17 attempts to remove the element
at index 1. Since Java uses zero-based indexes, there isn’t an element there and the code throws an IndexOutOfBoundsException.
49. C. The declaration of witch is incorrect. It tries to store a char into a String variable reference. This does not compile, making Option C correct. If this was fixed, the answer
would be Option B.
50. C. The Java 8 date and time classes are immutable. This means they do not contain setter methods and the code does not compile.
