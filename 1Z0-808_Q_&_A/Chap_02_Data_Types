========================================= Answers ========================================================

1. A. Option A does not compile because Java does not allow declaring different types as part
of the same declaration. The other three options show various legal combinations of combining multiple variables in the same declarations with optional default values.
2. D. The table variable is initialized to "metal". However, chair is not initialized. In Java, initialization is per variable and not for all the variables in a single declaration. 
Therefore, the second line tries to reference an uninitialized local variable and does not compile, which makes Option D correct.
3. B. Instance variables have a default value based on the type. For any non-primitive, including String, that type is a reference to null. Therefore Option B is correct. 
If the variable was a local variable, Option C would be correct.
4. B. An identifier name must begin with a letter, $, or _. Numbers are only permitted for subsequent characters. Therefore, Option B is not a valid variable name.
5. B. In Java, class names begin with an uppercase letter by convention. Then they use lowercase with the exception of new words. Option B follows this convention and is correct.
Option A follows the convention for variable names. Option C follows the convention for constants. Option D doesn’t follow any Java conventions.

6. C. Objects have instance methods while primitives do not. Since int is a primitive, you cannot call instance methods on it. Integer and String are both objects and have instance methods. 
Therefore, Option C is correct.
7. C. Underscores are allowed between any two digits in a numeric literal. Underscores are not allowed at the beginning or end of the literal, making Option C the correct answer.
8. C. Option A is incorrect because int is a primitive. Option B is incorrect because it is not the name of a class in Java. While Option D is a class in Java, it is not a wrapper class
because it does not map to a primitive. Therefore, Option C is correct.
9. C. There is no class named integer. There is a primitive int and a class Integer. Therefore, the code does not compile, and Option C is correct. If the type was changed to
Integer, Option B would be correct.
10. C. The new keyword is used to call the constructor for a class and instantiate an instance of the class. A primitive cannot be created using the new keyword. Dealing with references
happens after the object created by new is returned.

11. D. Java uses the suffix f to indicate a number is a float. Java automatically widens a type, allowing a float to be assigned to either a float or a double. This makes both lines p1 and
p3 compile. Line p2 does compile without a suffix. Line p4 does not compile without a suffix and therefore is the answer.
12. A. A byte is smaller than a char, making Option C incorrect. bigint is not a primitive, making Option D incorrect. A double uses twice as much memory as a float variable,
therefore Option A is correct.
13. D. The instance variables, constructor, and method names can appear in any order within a class declaration.
14. B. Java does not allow multiple Java data types to be declared in the same declaration, making Option B the correct answer. If double was removed, both hot and cold would be
the same type. Then the compiler error would be on x3 because of a reference to an uninitialized variable.
15. C. Lines 2 and 7 illustrate instance initializers. Line 6 is a static initializer. Lines 3–5 are a constructor.

16. A. Since defaultValue is a local variable, it is not automatically initialized. That means the code will not compile with any type. Therefore, Option A is correct. If this was an
instance variable, Option C would be correct as int and short would be initialized to 0 while double would be initialized to 0.0.
17. A. The finalize() method may not be called, such as if your program crashes. However,it is guaranteed to be called no more than once.
18. D. String is a class, but it is not a wrapper class. In order to be a wrapper class, the class must have a one-to-one mapping with a primitive.
19. C. Lines 15–17 create the three objects. Lines 18–19 change the references so link2 and link3 point to each other. The lines 20–21 wipe out two of the original references.
This means the object with name as x is inaccessible.
20. C. Options A and D are incorrect because byte and short do not store values with decimal points. Option B is tempting. However, 3.14 is automatically a double. It requires
casting to float or writing 3.14f in order to be assigned to a float. Therefore, Option C is correct.

21. B. Integer is the name of a class in Java. While it is bad practice to use the name of a class as your local variable name, this is legal. Therefore, k1 does compile. It is not legal to use
a reserved word as a variable name. All of the primitives including int are reserved words. Therefore, k2 does not compile, and Option B is the answer. Line k4 doesn’t compile either,
but the question asks about the first line to not compile.
22. B. Dot notation is used for both reading and writing instance variables, assuming they are in scope. It cannot be used for referencing local variables, making Option B the correct answer.
23. C. Class names follow the same requirements as other identifiers. Underscores and dollar signs are allowed. Numbers are allowed, but not as the first character of an identifier.
Therefore, Option C is correct. Note that class names begin with an uppercase letter by convention, but this is not a requirement.
24. D. This question is tricky as it appears to be about primitive vs. wrapper classes. Looking closely, there is an underscore right before the decimal point. 
This is illegal as the underscore in a numeric literal can only appear between two digits.
25. C. Local variables do not have a default initialization value. If they are referenced before being set to a value, the code does not compile. 
Therefore, Option C is correct. If the variable was an instance variable, Option B would be correct. Option D is tricky. 
*A local variable will compile without an initialization if it isn’t referenced anywhere or it is assigned a value before it is referenced.

26. C. Since defaultValue is an instance variable, it is automatically initialized to the corresponding value for that type. 
For double, that value is 0.0. By contrast, it is 0 for int, long, and short. Therefore Option C is correct.
27. B. Option B is an example of autoboxing. Java will automatically convert from primitive to wrapper class types and vice versa. Option A is incorrect because you can only call methods
on an object. Option C is incorrect because this method is used for converting to a wrapper class from a String. Option D is incorrect because autoboxing will convert the primitive to
an object before adding it to the ArrayList.
28. C. Java does not allow calling a method on a primitive. While autoboxing does allow the assignment of an Integer to an int, it does not allow calling an instance method on a
primitive. Therefore, the last line does not compile.
29. D. In order to call a constructor, you must use the new keyword. It cannot be called as if it was a normal method. This rules out Options A and B. Further, Option C is incorrect
because the parentheses are required.
30. A. Option A (I) correctly assigns the value to both variables. II does not compile as dog does not have a type. Notice the semicolon in that line, which starts a new statement. III
compiles but only assigns the value to dog since a declaration only assigns to one variable rather than everything in the declaration. IV does not compile because the type should only
be specified once per declaration.

31. C. The wrapper class for int is Integer and the wrapper class for char is Character. All other primitives have the same name. For example, the wrapper class for boolean is Boolean.
32. A. Assuming the variables are not primitives, they allow a null assignment. The other statements are false.
33. A. An example of a primitive type is int. All the primitive types are lowercase, making Option A correct. Unlike object reference variables, primitives cannot reference null.
String is not a primitive as evidenced by the uppercase letter in the name and the fact that we can call methods on it. You can create your own classes, but not primitives.
34. D. While you can suggest to the JVM that it might want to run a garbage collection cycle, the JVM is free to ignore your suggestion. Option B is how to make this suggestion. Since
garbage collection is not guaranteed to run, Option D is correct.
35. C. All three references point to the String apple. This makes the other two String objectseligible for garbage collection and Option C correct.

36. B. A constructor can only be called with a class name rather than a primitive, making Options A and C incorrect. The newly constructed Double object can be assigned to either
a double or Double thanks to autoboxing. Therefore, Option B is correct.
37. B. First line 2 runs and sets the variable using the declaration. Then the instance initializer on line 6 runs. Finally, the constructor runs. Since the constructor is the last to run of the
three, that is the value that is set when we print the result, so Option B is correct.
38. C. Objects are allowed to have a null reference while primitives cannot. int is a primitive, so assigning null to it does not compile. Integer and String are both objects and
can therefore be assigned a null reference. Therefore, Option C is correct.
39. C. An instance variable can only be referenced from instance methods in the class. A static variable can be referenced from any method. Therefore, Option C is correct.
40. B. Underscores are allowed between any two digits in a numeric literal. Underscores are not allowed adjacent to a decimal point, making Option B the correct answer.

41. A. These four types represent nondecimal values. While you don’t need to know the exact sizes, you do need to be able to order them from largest to smallest. A byte is smallest.
A short comes next, followed by int and then long. Therefore, Option A is correct.
42. A. Java uses dot notation to reference instance variables in a class, making Option A correct.
43. B. If there was a finalize() method, this would be a different story. However, the method here is finalizer. Tricky! That’s just a normal method that doesn’t get called
automatically. Therefore clean is never output.
44. A. Options B and C do not compile. In Java, braces are for arrays rather than instance variables. Option A is the correct answer. It uses dot notation to access the instance variable. It
also shows that a private variable is accessible in the same class and that a narrower type is allowed to be assigned to a wider type.
45. B. The parseInt() methods return a primitive. The valueOf() methods return a wrapper class object. In real code, autoboxing would let you assign the return value to either a
primitive or wrapper class. In terms of what gets returned directly, Option B is correct.

46. B. On line 9, all three objects have references. The elena and zoe objects have a direct reference. The diana object is referenced through the elena object. 
On line 10, the reference to the diana object is replaced by a reference to the zoe object. Therefore, the diana
object is eligible to be garbage collected, and Option B is correct.
47. C. Options A and B are static methods rather than constructors. Option D is a method that happens to have the same name as the class. It is not a constructor because constructors don’t have return types.
48. A. Remember that garbage collection is not guaranteed to run on demand. If it doesn’t run at all, Option B would be output. If it runs at the requested point, Option C would be
output. If it runs right at the end of the main() method, Option D would be output. Option A is the correct answer because play is definitely called twice. Note that you are unlikely
to see all these scenarios if you run this code because we have not used enough memory for garbage collection to be worth running. However, you still need to be able to answer what
could happen regardless of it being unlikely.
49. B. Each wrapper class has a constructor that takes the primitive equivalent. The methods mentioned in Options A, C, and D do not exist.
50. C. The main() method calls the constructor which outputs a. Then the main method calls the run() method. The run() method calls the constructor again, which outputs a again.
Then the run() method calls the Sand() method, which happens to have the same name as the constructor. This outputs b. Therefore, Option C is correct.

how to convert short to int and vise-versa in java?
  ->short to int (Widening Conversion)
                        short myShort = 32767; // Maximum value a short can hold
                        int myInt = myShort;   // Implicit conversion (widening)
                        // Explicit cast (not really necessary in this direction, but good to know)
                        myInt = (int) myShort;
                        System.out.println(myInt); // Output: 32767 (same result)

 ->int to short (Narrowing Conversion)
                        int myInt = 65000;  // A value larger than a short can hold
                        short myShort = (short) myInt; // Explicit cast (narrowing)
