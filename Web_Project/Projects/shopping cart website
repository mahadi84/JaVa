I want to design a four-menu website with home, a shopping cart for selling six different books at different prices, a Wishlist, and a contact us page as Java web application that support eclipse version 2024.
-Homepage contains a paragraph of text
-The shopping cart page contains 
Functional Shopping Cart: book as product (image, title, price, quantity). The cart page should clearly display selected items, quantities, prices, and provide options for updating or removing items.
-For reliable order processing, especially if users leave and return, server-side sessions or a database linked to user accounts are recommended.
-The user will register with name, email, and phone, and a login is required to complete the order

-visually represent the "add to wishlist" functionality (using a font icon like Font Awesome or Bootstrap Icons, or a custom image) and how the jQuery will target and update its state when a user clicks it.
-also, A server-side wishlist across devices and user accounts functionalities, 
-involves jQuery to dynamically adjust the cart display and potentially local storage or server-side logic to persist the cart data.
-After successful purchase/order payment amount will be stored in the table. Payment gateway is not recommended now, I will implement it later

-Admin dashboard to add and upload products like images, price per quantity, total quantity, and publisher name. and will check all the order lists and show details on click
-quantity will be updated once the product is sold
