--OR--

create:
"1. Database Setup: Create an employee database with a table containing fields for ID, name, and email. Include a database connection class that automatically closes the connection after queries.
2. Controller: Build a single HTTP Servlet to handle create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) requests. Prevent duplicate email entries from an external Bootstrap 5 form and display "Already exists" if a duplicate is detected. Show results in a Bootstrap 5 responsive table. Allow updates or deletions only for the user who entered the data (using sessions). Display "No data updated" if no new data is provided. Restrict CRUD page access to logged-in users.
3. DAO: Implement a Data Access Object (DAO) for database operations.
4. Model: Create a model class to represent employee data.
5. Forms: Design Bootstrap 5 responsive forms for login, data insertion, display, and updates in the Java Eclipse web application."
