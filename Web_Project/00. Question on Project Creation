01.
How can I create a Java web application using Eclipse IDE 2024 that 
processes an HTML form request using a Servlet, 
connects to a MySQL database (with automatic connection closure after queries), 
implements MVC architecture for CRUD operations (e.g., Employee ID, name, age), 
manages sessions for HTML pages, and displays success or error messages upon form submission?
