"How can I create a Java web application using Servlets to process HTML form requests, 
connect to a MySQL database, and implement MVC architecture for CRUD operations (e.g., managing employee details like ID, name, and age)?
Additionally, how can I handle sessions and display success/error messages after form submission in Eclipse IDE?
