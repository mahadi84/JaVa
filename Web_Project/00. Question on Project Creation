How can I implement a Java Servlet to process an HTML form request, connect to a MySQL database, and use MVC architecture to perform CRUD operations 
(e.g., for an Employee with attributes like ID, name, and age)? 
Additionally, how can you manage sessions and display success or error messages after submitting the form? give me java code on this.
