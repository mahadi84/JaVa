How can I create a Java web application using Eclipse IDE 2024 that 
processes an HTML form request using a Servlet, 
connects to a MySQL database (with automatic connection closure after queries), 
implements MVC architecture for CRUD operations (e.g., Employee ID, name, age), 
manages sessions for HTML pages, and displays success or error messages upon form submission?

How can I develop a single HTML page CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using Java in Eclipse IDE (version 2024)? The application should include the following features:
  -A single HTML page with forms and buttons to perform CRUD operations (e.g., for managing employee records with fields like ID, name, and age).
  -A Java backend using Servlets to handle HTTP requests (GET, POST) for CRUD operations.
  -Integration with a MySQL database to store and retrieve data, with automatic connection management (e.g., using try-with-resources to close connections after queries).
  -Implementation of the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture:
    Model: Java classes to represent the data (e.g., Employee.java) and interact with the database (e.g., EmployeeDAO.java).
    View: A single HTML page (index.html or index.jsp) to display the form, data table, and success/error messages.
    Controller: Servlets to process form submissions and manage the flow of data between the view and model.
  -Use of sessions to display success or error messages after form submissions (e.g., "Employee added successfully" or "Error: Employee not found").
