How can I create a Java web application using Eclipse IDE 2024 that 
processes an HTML form request using a Servlet, 
connects to a MySQL database (with automatic connection closure after queries), 
implements MVC architecture for CRUD operations (e.g., Employee ID, name, age), 
manages sessions for HTML pages, and displays success or error messages upon form submission?


02.
How can I create a simple single-page CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application 
using Java Servlets and Eclipse IDE 2024, where all the operations are performed on an HTML page without navigating away from the page? 
The application should use a MySQL database for storing data and be structured to follow the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern.
