04. Web Services: Discuss RESTful and SOAP web services and how to create and consume them.
05. Microservices: Explain the concept of microservices architecture and its benefits.

=========== Problem-Solving and Critical Thinking =========== 
Coding Challenges: You may be asked to solve coding problems on the spot or complete a coding exercise before or during the interview.
Design Patterns: Discuss common design patterns (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Observer) and how they can be applied in Java.
Performance Optimization: Explain techniques for optimizing Java code for performance.
Debugging: Describe your approach to debugging Java applications.

=========== Cultural Fit =========== 
Teamwork: Questions about your experience working in teams and your ability to collaborate.
Communication: Your ability to communicate technical concepts clearly and effectively will be evaluated.
